# TOEFL-Native-Language-Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the native language of non-native English speakers using responses from TOEFL exams. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the aim is to analyze linguistic features in written text to classify each response into distinct native language groups.

Methodology and Implementation:
- Data Processing: Utilized TOEFL exam text data, applying text vectorization techniques such as TF-IDF to convert text into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Model Development: Implemented several models with a primary focus on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifiers. The project explored multiple classification strategies, starting with a basic model to predict broad language groups before refining predictions to specific languages.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducted extensive tuning of model parameters to enhance accuracy and performance.

- Cross-Validation: Employed cross-validation techniques to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the models.

Key Results:
- Developed a multi-tier classification system that initially categorizes responses into language families and subsequently into specific languages.
Achieved substantial accuracy in predicting language groups, demonstrating the effectiveness of the chosen machine learning techniques in handling linguistic data.

- The final model showcased improved predictive performance through strategic model training, hyperparameter adjustments, and validation methods.

Conclusion:
- This project illustrates the power of machine learning in the field of linguistic analysis, offering valuable insights into the influence of native language on English usage. It highlights the potential applications of such technologies in educational settings and language studies.
